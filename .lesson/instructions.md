# Task - Predict and Run

This task contains three code examples.

Look at each example , study it carefully.  Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs.  Your prediction should be added to the code as comments. You should use the key terms **selection, condition** and **branch** in your prediction.

## Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:

- a colon at the end of each if and else line.
- each branch is indented unsing the TAB key (not just spaces)
- no condition after 'else'
- a **double** equals in the condition when chcking that two pieces of data are the same.
